# A Componentized World

The idea of a component is basically the same as a module. We have been using modules for a long time now for good reason. They are reusable, composable, and predictable. We can move them around between projects and distribute them through repositories like npm. With front end libraries and frameworks like React, Vue, Elm and Angular 2 components are becoming the standard practice for building UIs today.

This is part of a greater movment in UI development and applications in general which is a rediscovery of functional programing.
